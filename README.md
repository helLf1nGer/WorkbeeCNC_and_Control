Workbee CNC with Custom Built Control System

Workbee project is courtesy of Ryan Lock

We changed some parameters of the build itself as well as added touch plate for precision tool change.
Added self-aligning feature based on the limit switches protected by optoisolator.

Control Unit Features (Test Build):

-Splitted power to avoid noise between motor drivers and digital control.
-24V Power Supply
-Relay with emergency stop and power surge protection (15A)
-GRBL 1.1h motion control
-Optoisolated limit switch control (allows for no-compromise noise cancellation and excellent self-aligning while homing)
-Detachable magnetic touch plate for semi-automatic tool change (industrial machine level precision)

Dust Shoe features centrifugal suction of the dust and better attachment rigidity of the router on the mahcine:
